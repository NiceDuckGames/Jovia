# ‚ú®Jovia - Open Source AI Framework for Godot üéÆ

Welcome to Jovia! This is an open-source AI tool designed to assist developers working with the Godot game engine. Jovia, built using Rust, allows developers to interact with a game development assistant powered by AI, capable of executing instructions within the Godot engine.

## Feature Roadmap üöÄ

- ‚òëÔ∏è **Interactive Assistant**: Interact with a game development assistant using natural language commands.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Godot Integration**: Execute model inference from GDScript.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Local Models**: Utilize locally hosted AI models for enhanced privacy and offline functionality.
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Text Generation**: Our first goal is to enable text generation via LLMs from the Godot game engine in an efficient manner.
- **Image Generation**: We plan to include image generation capabilities to aid in texture generation, texture repeating, among other things directly from Godot.
- **Mesh Generation**: Generate 3D meshes from text prompts straight from within the Godot game engine.
- **Future Hosted Option**: The project aims to offer a hosted option in the future for convenience and scalability.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with Jovia, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NiceDuckGames/jovia.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd jovia`
3. Build the project using Rust: `cargo build -p server --release`
4. Run the tool: `./target/release/jovia`

## Usage üïπÔ∏è

1. Launch the Jovia tool.
2. Interact with the assistant using natural language commands.
3. The assistant will execute instructions within the Godot game engine.

## Contributing ü§ù

We are not currently accepting pull-requests on this repository from people outside of our team, though we probably will once the project reaches a certain level of stability and usefulness.

Instead if you would like to contribute, please open an issue for discussion first or create a [discussion](https://github.com/NiceDuckGames/jovia/discussions).

An additional way to contribute to the project is to contribute to the datasets used to create the custom models.

### Contributing to the Model Dataset
#### Command Sequence Data
To contribute your own command sequence data to the model dataset see the [Submitting Your Own Data](https://github.com/NiceDuckGames/DuckyCommandDataset?tab=readme-ov-file#submitting-training-data) section of the ducky-command-dataset repository.

#### GDScript Data
If you wish to contribute GDScript source code for use in training the jovia codegen model see the [ducky-ai-codegen-optins](https://github.com/NiceDuckGames/ducky-ai-codegen-optins) repository for instruction on how to do that.
